Description: ORC is a self-describing type-aware columnar file format designed
 for Hadoop workloads. It is optimized for large streaming reads,
 but with integrated support for finding required rows quickly.
 Storing data in a columnar format lets the reader read, decompress,
 and process only the values that are required for the current query.
 Because ORC files are type-aware, the writer chooses the most
 appropriate encoding for the type and builds an internal index as
 the file is written. Predicate pushdown uses those indexes to
 determine which stripes in a file need to be read for a particular
 query and the row indexes can narrow the search to a particular set
 of 10,000 rows. ORC supports the complete set of types in Hive,
 including the complex types: structs, lists, maps, and unions.
